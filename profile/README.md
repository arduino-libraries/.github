## ðŸ¤— Welcome to the **Arduino Libraries** open source community!

This organization hosts the official libraries maintained or supervised by the Arduino team. If you want to submit your own library, check out the instructions of the [library registry](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry).

If you're looking for other Arduino repositories such as [IDE](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide), [CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli), the [Arduino API spec](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API) or the various cores see the [github.com/arduino](https://github.com/arduino) organization instead.

Maintaining these libraries and handling community contributions is a hard job. Please support us by [buying original Arduino products](https://store.arduino.cc/). Your help will be very appreciated.

### âœ¨ How you can contribute

* **Triage** open issues: try to reproduce issues reported by other users and confirm whether you can experience them as well, or ask users for more details if needed. Spot duplicates. Improve descriptions. Help users who ask for support.
* **Submit** fixes and implementations: pick an open issue or feature request that you think you can implement yourself, and submit a pull request with an implementation.
* **Test** open pull requests: try to run the proposed modifications and report your success or failure. Testing on real hardware takes time and any help in this will speed up our responsiveness in merging contributions.
* **Help others** contribute by reviewing their code and suggesting good ways to implement fixes and features.
* **Write more examples** to demonstrate how to use the various features.
* **Write documentation** about library usage and API. It should be placed under the `docs/` directory in each repository and written in Markdown.

We value contributions and we provide the most active and constant contributors with public recognition and hardware goodies.
